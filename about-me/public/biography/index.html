                <h2 id="early-childhood">Early Childhood</h2>
<p>As a child, I was captivated by the James Bond films, particularly the scenes where Q would present Bond with the latest
high-tech gadgets. These gadgets, which seemed impossible to exist, sparked my fascination and made me say &ldquo;wow&rdquo; every
time. This early exposure to seemingly impossible innovations ignited my passion for new technologies and the desire to
create groundbreaking solutions.</p>
<h2 id="technical-school--high-school-2016-2020">Technical School / High School (2016-2020)</h2>
<p>I attended a technical school with a mechatronics profile. This profile gave me a lot of pleasure and I won school
competitions. Most importantly, I learned the first programming language C++. Programming in C++ gave me a sense of
total freedom in creation and further fueled my passion for technology and this led me to choose infrmatics as my field
of study</p>
<h2 id="university-studies-2020-now">University Studies (2020-now)</h2>
<p>I then began my studies at Rzeszow University of Technology, majoring in computer science. At the beginning I was not
doing so well, but after some time and arranging my life I began to earn very good grades and I fell in love with such
subjects as algorithms and data structures, mathematics and, above all, artificial intelligence, where I was the only
person in the year who got the best grade.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning-scientific-club-2023-now">Machine Learning Scientific Club 2023-now</h2>
<p>Joining the Machine Learning Scientific Club was a pivotal moment in my academic journey. This club provided me with
numerous opportunities, including meeting experts in the field of Machine Learning and gaining invaluable knowledge from
them. I participated in various programming competitions and hackathons, which broadened my understanding and skills.
The club also allowed me to work on significant projects such as TrailBlazerML and MyBrowarek. Additionally, I developed
essential soft skills, such as teamwork and leadership, by managing a team of 20 members as a project manager for these
projects.</p>
