## TrailBlazerML

the project is to construct an entire autonomous driving system for the legendary PRz rover.
it works on the basis of readings from the OAK-D-pro stereo camera where we filter out the depth image to then add it to
the global map where the route is plotted (in short)

## Project: Decoding Motor Intentions Using EEG Signals

My project focuses on decoding motor intentions using EEG (electroencephalography) signals. In our research, we use an
advanced system with 64 EEG probes, allowing for precise recording of brain activity.

The aim of the project is to create advanced models that are primarily based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) LSTM in
particular. These
models are designed to decode motor intentions, both imagined and real, related to limb movements. This work has the
potential to significantly impact the development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies and neurorehabilitation
therapies.

The project also involves the construction of a comprehensive research environment in which we test models with various
parameters, examining the impact of individual parameters on the model's learning process. Our goal is to optimize these
parameters to achieve the best possible results.

## MyBrowarek

As part of the Machine Learning scientific club, I managed the MyBrowarek project, which involved a 20-person team. Our
goal was to create an innovative mobile application dedicated to beer enthusiasts.

The MyBrowarek project had several key objectives:

1. Creating a mobile application: The application aimed to serve beer enthusiasts by offering various features to
   explore
   the world of beer. The application was based on the Django framework and React, providing modern and efficient
   technological solutions.
2. Implementing an intoxication recognition model: In the future, we plan to implement a model to recognize the level of
   user intoxication, allowing us to deliver personalized advice and warnings. For this purpose, we planned to use
   PyTorch,
   a popular machine learning library.
3. Knowledge transfer: One of the main goals of the project was to transfer knowledge from experienced club members to
   new
   members. We wanted new participants to learn practical skills related to machine learning and project management.
4. Managing a large project: This project was an excellent opportunity to manage a large team and a complex project,
   helping to develop organizational and managerial skills.

As the project manager, I coordinated the team's work, ensuring that all tasks were completed on schedule. I also
managed team communication and ensured efficient problem-solving throughout the project's duration.

The MyBrowarek project not only contributed to the creation of an innovative application but also facilitated the
development of team members' skills, preparing them for future challenges in the fields of machine learning and project
management.

## Jumbuster

The Jumbuster project is an advanced system aimed at optimizing drivers' departure times to avoid encounters at
intersections, thereby reducing traffic congestion in the city. We use a reinforcement learning algorithm that
dynamically adjusts departure schedules based on real-time traffic conditions.

Key Objectives of the Jumbuster Project:
1. **Optimizing departure times:** The system analyzes and determines the most effective departure times for drivers,
minimizing the risk of encounters at intersections, which allows for smoother traffic flow in the city.
2. **Reducing traffic congestion:** By better managing departure times, the system helps reduce street congestion, improving
overall traffic quality in the city.
3. **Creating a mobile application:** The application allows users to input their starting point and destination, and then
determines the optimal departure time, taking into account current traffic conditions and potential disruptions.
4. **Reinforcement learning algorithm:** We use advanced machine learning techniques so that the system can continuously learn
and adapt to changing traffic conditions, ensuring its effectiveness and accuracy.

Jumbuster not only improves traffic flow but also assists drivers in planning their trips, leading to savings in time
and fuel. By utilizing the latest technologies and learning algorithms, our system provides an innovative solution to
the problems associated with urban traffic congestion.
