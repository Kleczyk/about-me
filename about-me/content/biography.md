## Early Childhood

As a child, I was captivated by the James Bond films, particularly the scenes where Q would present Bond with the latest
high-tech gadgets. These gadgets, which seemed impossible to exist, sparked my fascination and made me say "wow" every
time. This early exposure to seemingly impossible innovations ignited my passion for new technologies and the desire to
create groundbreaking solutions.

## Technical School / High School (2016-2020)

I attended a technical school with a mechatronics profile. This profile gave me a lot of pleasure and I won school
competitions. Most importantly, I learned the first programming language C++. Programming in C++ gave me a sense of
total freedom in creation and further fueled my passion for technology and this led me to choose infrmatics as my field
of study

## University Studies (2020-now)

I then began my studies at Rzeszow University of Technology, majoring in computer science. At the beginning I was not
doing so well, but after some time and arranging my life I began to earn very good grades and I fell in love with such
subjects as algorithms and data structures, mathematics and, above all, artificial intelligence, where I was the only
person in the year who got the best grade.

## Machine Learning Scientific Club 2023-now

Joining the Machine Learning Scientific Club was a pivotal moment in my academic journey. This club provided me with
numerous opportunities, including meeting experts in the field of Machine Learning and gaining invaluable knowledge from
them. I participated in various programming competitions and hackathons, which broadened my understanding and skills.
The club also allowed me to work on significant projects such as TrailBlazerML and MyBrowarek. Additionally, I developed
essential soft skills, such as teamwork and leadership, by managing a team of 20 members as a project manager for these
projects.
